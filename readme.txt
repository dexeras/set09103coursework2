To launch the web application, you first need to install the py-bcrypt library. To do so, type the following lines in the src folder : 

1 $ sudo su
2 # easy_install py_bcrypt-0.4-py2.7-linux-i686.egg
3 # exit
4 $ python -c " import bcrypt "


the only left thing needed is to run the main.py file, still being in the src folder, using : 

$ python main.py

you can then access the application by typing the URL "localhost:5000" in your web browser once the application is successfully launched.
